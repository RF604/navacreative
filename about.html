  <h2>Susy Segal</h2>

  <div class="column4">
  
  <p>Owner and head chef, Susy Siegel started catering over 25 years ago when her passion for entertaining and natural facility in the culinary arts manifested into a small, but flourishing catering company. Susy is originally from Mexico City, where the flavours, odors, and colors of Latin Cuisine blend with Continental cooking. She spent several years in Israel where she added to her repertoire the nuances of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern Cuisine. It is no wonder that Susy possesses a special skill and sensibility for all types of ethnic cooking.
      
  <br><br>
  
  In addition to her impeccable reputation in the kitchen, she is well known for creating exceptional working relations with her clients. In this regard, what seldom fails to be mentioned enthusiastically by her clientele is the sense of trust and calm that Susy instills in them, making them feel that they can hand the reins over to Susy and expect every single detail to be addressed with success from beginning to end. In the words of one such client, “I feel as if my event is the only one being catered in town.”

  <h2>Eran Rozen</h2>
  <br>

  <div class="column4">
  
  <p>Israeli-born chef Eran Rozen grew up in a small town south of coastal Tel Aviv and spent most of his life in Jerusalem. Following seventeen years of service in the Israeli Police Force, Chef Rozen moved to Canada with his wife and two young boys. The move became an opportunity for him to follow his dream of becoming a professional chef, one which began with his Sephardic grandmother, whose culinary lessons and secrets continue to guide his work today. He and his family settled in Vancouver, where Chef Rozen enrolled in the Pacific Institute of Culinary Arts. He then gained important experience working in both traditional French Bistros and Patisseries as well as in the catering industry, followed by the opening of Gaia Bistro, his own classically-inspired Mediterranean and North African restaurant.
      
  <br><br>      

  Since closing the restaurant, Chef Rozen has worked side-by-side with owner Susy Siegel as the executive chef of Nava Creative Kosher Cuisine, Vancouver’s premier kosher caterer. With the help of his experienced, multicultural staff, Chef Rozen enjoys working at the heart of Vancouver’s Jewish community. He seeks to provide traditional Jewish menus as well as modern kosher reimaginings of international flavours, using his classical training, his own familial influences, and the culinary experiences of his diverse and talented staff.
